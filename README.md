# Craftalot
My first plugin in development, a plugin based off the favourited game mode from Minecraft Showdown.

The game involves a large group of players fighting to be the fastest crafter of them all. Travelling to collect items traditionally through water tunnels to collect materials. Edguard (The king's loyal assistant will provide you with instructions on what the king requires.

This gamemode generally requires a group of atleast 8 players or more to be fully competitive, but it can be a fun small duel or battle between friends in smaller groups.
